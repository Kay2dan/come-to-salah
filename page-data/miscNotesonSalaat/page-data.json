While, if a deduction is made from the prayer, then, the two prostrations of forgetfulness should be performed before reciting the Tasleem.

If this omission occurred in the first rakaat and the person remembers the omission while in the course of the second Rakaat, then, the person should count the second Rakaat as being the first Rakaat and treat the first one in which he/she missed to recite the 'Al-Fatihah' as null and void.
