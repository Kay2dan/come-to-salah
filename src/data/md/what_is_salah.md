# WHAT IS SALAH

Salaat (Prayer) is one of the main obligations which 'Allah (SWT)' has ordained on His servants. It is the first act of worship decreed on the Muslim Nation (Ummah) by 'Allah (SWT)' and was ordained on the night of the Prophet's (PBUH) ascension to the seven heavens.

It is the second of the five pillars of Islam after the proclamation of the 'Shahada' (the words of witness).

It is enjoined on the Muslims as an obligatory act by' Allah (SWT)' as can be noted from the following verses of the Holy Qur'an:

'ESTABLISH REGULAR PRAYERS AT THE SUN'S DECLINE TILL THE DARKNESS OF THE NIGHT, AND THE MORNING PRAYER....'. (Qur'an 17:78)
'أَقِمِ الصَّلَاةَ لِدُلُوكِ الشَّمْسِ إِلَىٰ غَسَقِ اللَّيْلِ وَقُرْآنَ الْفَجْر'
(17:78)

In another verse 'Allah (SWT)' says:

'AND ESTABLISH REGULAR PRAYERS AT THE TWO ENDS OF THE DAY AND AT THE APPROACHES OF THE NIGHT.' (Qur'an 11:114)
'وَأَقِمِ الصَّلَاةَ طَرَفَيِ النَّهَارِ وَزُلَفًا مِّنَ اللَّيْلِ ۚ '
(114:11)

The importance of the Salaat has also been explicitly expressed by Allah's Messenger (PBUH), as can be noted from the following sayings:
'What lies between a perfect man and disbelief is the leaving of prayer'. (Related by Imams Ahmed and Muslim)

The Prophet (PBUH) also said:

'The obligation which separates us from them (the non-believers) is the prayer and he who renounces it becomes a disbeliever.' (Related by Imams Ahmed and Muslim)

The above quoted Qur'anic commands by 'Allah (SWT)' and the honoured sayings of the Prophet (PBUH) clearly indicate the importance of Salaat such that it is unanimously agreed by all Muslim scholars that renouncing it is regarded an act of disbelief (Kufr).

## THE VIRTUES OF PRAYER

Salaat (Prayer) performed genuinely with humility and submission to 'Allah(SWT)' has unlimited virtues and benefits. It is the noblest expression of faith and the surest way of thanking 'Allah (SWT)' for His unlimited favours. It is the way to obtaining Allah's mercy, generosity, kindness, blessings and a sure way to paradise.

'Allah (SWT)' says in the Holy Qur'an:

'PROSPEROUS INDEED ARE THE BELIEVERS WHO ARE HUMBLE IN THEIR PRAYERS'.
'قَدْ أَفْلَحَ الْمُؤْمِنُونَ (1) الَّذِينَ هُمْ فِي صَلَاتِهِمْ خَاشِعُونَ
(Qur'an 23:1 -2)

It is a deliverance on the Day of Judgment for those who used to observe it well. The Prophet (PBUH) says:

'The first thing that the servant of 'Allah (SWT)' will be called to account for on the Day of Judgment will be the prayer; and if it was good the person's deeds will have been good, but if it was bad, the person's deeds will have been bad'. (Reported by Imam bhukari)

Prayer purifies the soul, refines the character and inculcates in man the excellent virtues of truthfulness, honesty and modesty. It keeps one who performs it from falsehood and from all forbidden actions as is categorically confirmed by the following verse of the Holy Qur'an:

'...VERILY, PRAYER REFRAINS FROM INDECENCY AND EVIL...'(Qur'an 29:45)
'...وَأَقِمِ الصَّلَاةَ ۖ إِنَّ الصَّلَاةَ تَنْهَىٰ عَنِ الْفَحْشَاءِ وَالْمُنكَرِ ۗ ..'
(29:45)
